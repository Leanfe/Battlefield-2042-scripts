# Battlefield-2042-scripts
- zoom.fx

Not really needed, but not nothing. Install reshade (google) Drop the file into the "reshade shaders/shaders" folder within the game folder. Until they approve the file here is the code. Simply copy, paste into notepad, save as "zoom.fx"

Once in the game, press home key, find and check the box next to zoom.fx, and you can edit the zoom quantity and key. By default I set it to right click down/up

Right now reshade isnt banned in BF242. It was banned for BFV so it may be in the future. From my experience, that doesnt include time away from the game, the game just wont launch until you remove the file.
